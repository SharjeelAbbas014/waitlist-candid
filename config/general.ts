          "Nano Hydroxyapatite (n-HA) is a biomaterial that mimics the mineral form of human bone and teeth. Unlike SLS and parabens, which can irritate and disrupt hormonal balance, nHA promotes remineralization, reduces sensitivity, and strengthens enamel without harmful side effects, making it a safer, effective alternative in toothpaste.",
